# Integration Testing Strategy (BaseFaq)

## Concise Summary
- Integration tests in this solution should validate real behavior across module boundaries with real PostgreSQL, real EF migrations, and production-like middleware/session rules.
- Current suites are strongest on command/query + DB persistence and tenant/soft-delete filters; biggest gaps are API auth flows, tenant-resolution middleware behavior, observability assertions, resilience/fault-injection, and third-party integration boundaries.
- Recommended execution tiers:
  - CI PR: deterministic, fast DB-backed integration pack.
  - Nightly: stress/concurrency/resilience and migration-drift checks.
  - Pre-release: full regression including auth and sandbox-provider checks.
- This plan defines environment/data strategy, risk matrix, and 30 concrete test cases with assertions/logging expectations.

## 1) Architecture Assumptions & Scope
### Assumptions (explicit)
- Platform is multi-service but codebase currently exposes 4 APIs:
  - `BaseFaq.Faq.Portal.Api`
  - `BaseFaq.Faq.Public.Api`
  - `BaseFaq.Tenant.BackOffice.Api`
  - `BaseFaq.Tenant.Portal.Api`
- Persistence is PostgreSQL via EF Core with tenant-aware filters and soft delete.
- Redis is used for allowed-tenant caching (`RedisAllowedTenantStore`).
- RabbitMQ/SMTP are available in docker base services, but queue/worker execution paths are currently limited or not yet covered by existing integration suites.
- Existing integration tests are mostly handler + DbContext level with real DBs and migrations.

### What “integration test” means here
- Integration test:
  - Verifies interactions between at least two components (e.g., handler + EF + DB constraints, middleware + claims + cache, API endpoint + auth + DB).
  - Uses real infrastructure components where practical (PostgreSQL always, Redis optionally, provider sandbox where needed).
- Not unit test:
  - Does not isolate with pure mocks of repositories/DbContexts.
- Not contract-only test:
  - Contract tests validate API/provider schema compatibility; they complement but do not replace DB/middleware behavior tests.
- Not full E2E:
  - E2E covers browser/client journeys across deployed services; integration tests stay at API/service boundary with controlled fixtures.

### Integration points to cover
- REST APIs (controllers + middleware + auth).
- DB integration (migrations, constraints, tenant filters, soft delete, sorting/pagination queries).
- Cache (Redis allowed-tenant store).
- Queues/event bus (when worker/event flows are implemented or enabled).
- File storage (if added later; currently treat as planned scope).
- Auth/identity (JWT validation, claims mapping, tenant authorization).
- External providers:
  - Auth0/OIDC metadata and token assumptions.
  - SMTP/email/analytics/webhooks where applicable.
- Background jobs/migrations runner flows.

### Execution tiers
- CI (per PR, blocking):
  - DB-backed deterministic integration tests.
  - No long sleeps, no external network dependency.
  - Includes migrations apply + core CRUD + tenant isolation + critical auth happy/negative paths.
- Nightly:
  - Concurrency/race tests, retry/idempotency, migration drift, resilience/fault injection.
  - Optional Redis and queue containerized runs.
- Pre-release:
  - Full integration pack + provider sandbox checks + backward compatibility + observability assertions.

## 2) Environment & Data Strategy
### Ephemeral environments
- Local and CI should run isolated ephemeral infrastructure:
  - Preferred: docker compose project per pipeline run (`bf_baseservices_<runId>`).
  - DB names per test run already follow random naming (`bf_faq_test_<guid>`), keep this pattern.
  - For API-level integration tests, run each API in test profile with dedicated test namespace/config.
- Add standardized env presets:
  - `INTEGRATION_TEST=true`
  - `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=IntegrationTest`
  - test-specific auth issuer/audience and Redis DB index.

### Deterministic data
- Use builders/factories (`TestDataFactory`) only; avoid ad hoc inline entities unless test intent requires edge fields.
- Seed baselines by scenario, not global mega-seed.
- Reset strategy:
  - Current per-test database creation/drop is good isolation.
  - For API-level suites with shared DB, use transaction rollback or schema recreate per class.
- Time control:
  - Introduce injectable clock abstraction for time-sensitive sorting/retry tests.
  - If not available, explicitly update timestamps in DB setup to remove race with system clock.

### PII and privacy-safe data
- Use synthetic addresses/domains (`example.test`, RFC5737 IP ranges) only.
- For any copied prod incidents, sanitize through deterministic tokenization.
- Block real tokens/secrets from fixtures and snapshots.

### Parallelization and isolation
- Keep test-level random DB names; this supports parallel test workers safely.
- Ensure Redis keys include suite prefix + test id when Redis integration tests are added.
- Disable flaky order dependencies by never relying on prior test side effects.

## 3) Advanced Integration Testing Techniques
### Consumer-driven contracts (Pact-style)
- Use contract tests for:
  - API consumers of each service and external provider adapters.
  - Versioned DTO fields and backward compatibility.
- Workflow:
  - Consumer generates pact from typed client tests.
  - Provider verifies pact in CI before merge.
  - Add broker/tag strategy per branch/release.
- Do not replace DB integration tests with pact tests; they serve different risk classes.

### DB integration patterns
- Migration validation:
  - Apply latest migrations from empty DB in CI.
  - Validate migration rollback on nightly (where feasible).
- Schema drift checks:
  - Compare EF model snapshot vs generated SQL hash in nightly.
- Transaction boundary tests:
  - Verify partial failures do not persist half-written aggregates.
- Idempotency checks:
  - Repeated command execution under same key/user should not duplicate records (already partially covered in voting).

### Event-driven testing
- When event publishing exists:
  - Assert event emitted exactly once per successful transaction.
  - Verify ordering constraints (if required) and idempotent consumers.
  - Test at-least-once behavior by replaying duplicate messages.
  - Add replay tests from dead-letter payloads.

### Resilience/fault injection
- Inject:
  - DB timeout / transient network fault.
  - Redis unavailable.
  - provider 429 and 5xx.
- Assert:
  - retries follow policy,
  - no duplicate writes,
  - circuit breaker open/half-open behavior,
  - graceful error mapping via API error middleware.

### Security integration
- Validate:
  - JWT token validation (issuer/audience/signature/expiry).
  - role/claim enforcement per endpoint.
  - tenant claim vs requested tenant mismatch handling.
  - skip-tenant-validation attribute only where explicitly allowed.

### Observability validation
- For critical flows assert:
  - structured logs include request id and tenant id.
  - traces propagate correlation id across middleware/handlers.
  - key counters/histograms emitted (errors, latency, retries).

## 4) High-Risk Matrix (Impact x Probability)
| Integration Point | Impact | Probability | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Auth token + claims mapping | High | Medium | P0 | Breaks all protected APIs silently if misconfigured |
| Tenant isolation filters | High | Medium | P0 | Data leak risk across tenants |
| Vote idempotency/concurrency | Medium | Medium | P1 | Double counting possible under race |
| Migrations/model drift | High | Medium | P0 | Release-blocking runtime failures |
| Sorting/pagination correctness | Medium | High | P1 | User-visible correctness regressions |
| Redis allowed-tenant cache | High | Low-Med | P1 | Wrong cache data can bypass/deny access |
| External provider outages/rate limits | Medium | Medium | P1 | Degraded UX; retry storms if unmanaged |
| Queue/event delivery semantics | High | Low (current) | P2 | Becomes P0 once workers are active |
| Observability pipeline | Medium | Medium | P2 | Slows incident response and root cause |

### Edge-case coverage matrix
- Concurrency: repeated create/update/vote from same and different identities.
- Eventual consistency: if async jobs/events introduced, poll-with-timeout assertions.
- Timezone/clock skew: UTC storage and deterministic sort by timestamps.
- Large payloads: max text lengths for FAQ answers and references.
- Pagination boundaries: empty page, last page, large skip.
- Filtering/sorting: unknown sort field fallback, multi-field sort.
- Versioning/backward compatibility: old client DTOs against new provider.

- Test data: factory + builder pattern (already present).
- API integration: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` + `WebApplicationFactory`.
- Contracts: PactNet (or equivalent) for consumer/provider checks.
- Resilience testing: policy test harness around retry/circuit behavior.
- Optional container orchestration in tests: Testcontainers for deterministic service startup.

### Local run
- Start base services: `./docker-base.sh`
- Run a project: `dotnet test dotnet/BaseFaq.Faq.Public.Test.IntegrationTests/BaseFaq.Faq.Public.Test.IntegrationTests.csproj`
- Run all integration projects:
  - `dotnet test dotnet/BaseFaq.Faq.Portal.Test.IntegrationTests/BaseFaq.Faq.Portal.Test.IntegrationTests.csproj`
  - `dotnet test dotnet/BaseFaq.Faq.Public.Test.IntegrationTests/BaseFaq.Faq.Public.Test.IntegrationTests.csproj`

  - `dotnet test dotnet/BaseFaq.Tenant.Portal.Test.IntegrationTests/BaseFaq.Tenant.Portal.Test.IntegrationTests.csproj`

### CI workflow
- Stage 1: restore/build/lint.
- Stage 2: integration tests in parallel by project.
- Stage 3 (nightly only): migration drift + resilience suite.
- Publish:
  - trx/junit reports,
  - flaky test dashboard,
  - trend of duration and failure categories.

### Flaky test management
- Define flake as non-deterministic pass/fail over 10 reruns.
- Auto-tag flaky tests and quarantine to nightly until fixed.
- Require root-cause issue for any quarantined test.
- Track top flake causes: timing, shared state, environment instability.

## 7) Exit Criteria & Quality Gates
### Pass/fail criteria
- 0 failed tests in required CI integration suite.
- No severity-1 flaky tests in blocking set.
